A tool for generating HTML visualizations of code metrics. As a proof-of-concept, the
first visualization is to create treemaps of CSV data like in this example:

## Deliverables

The proof of concept implementation will include:

* A program to generate the correct HTML/JavaScript page for a given CSV file
* The output will be suitable for static websites and for publishing in Jenkins
* Usage documentation
* Unit tests
* A continuous delivery pipeline for the software


## Tasks

* #1 Investigate treemaps and HTML snippets
